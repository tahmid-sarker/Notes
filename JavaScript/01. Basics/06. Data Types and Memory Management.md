# Primitive Data Types

1. Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Example: 5, 3.14.
2. String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Example: "Hello, world!".
3. Boolean: Represents a binary value, either true or false, often used for conditional logic.
4. Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value yet. Example: let x;.
5. Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value. Example: let y = null;.
6. Symbol (ES6): It is mostly used to find uniqueness.
7. BigInt (ES11): Represents large integers that cannot be represented by the Number type.

# Reference (Object Data Types):

1. Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs (properties and methods). Example: { name: "John", age: 30 }.
2. Array: Represents a list-like collection of values, indexed by numbers (integer indices). Example: [1, 2, 3, 4].
3. Function: Represents a reusable block of code that can be invoked or called with arguments. Example: function add(x, y) { return x + y; }.
4. Date: Represents dates and times.
5. RegExp: Represents regular expressions for pattern matching.

## Let's talk about some Range of Primitive Data Types:

1. Number:
    Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
    Typical Range: -9,007,199,254,740,992 (-2^53) to 9,007,199,254,740,992 (2^53) inclusive.
    Smallest Increment: 2^(-52).

2. String:
    Represents a sequence of characters.
    No specific range limit, but practical limits depend on memory and system resources.

3. Boolean:
    Represents true or false.
    Only two possible values: true and false.

4. Undefined:
    Represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value.
    It has only one possible value: undefined.

5. Null:
    Represents the intentional absence of any object or value.
    It has only one possible value: null.

6. Symbol (ES6):
    Represents a unique and immutable value.
    No specific range limit.

7. BigInt (ES11):
    Represents large integers that cannot be represented by the Number type.
    The range is practically unlimited and depends on available memory.
